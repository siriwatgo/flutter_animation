Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) 
animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and renders them natively on mobile!

This repository is an unofficial conversion of the [Lottie-android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) library in pure Dart. 

It works on Android, iOS, macOS, linux, windows and web.

## Rive

Rive Flutter is a runtime library for [Rive](https://rive.app), a real-time interactive design and animation tool.

This library allows you to fully control Rive files with a high-level API for simple interactions and animations, as well as a low-level API for creating custom render loops for multiple artboards, animations, and state machines in a single canvas.
